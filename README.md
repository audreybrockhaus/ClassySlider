##[Yet Another jQuery Slider](http://git.io/YAjS "YAjS Project Page")

###Scope:
* Rotate N slides of HTML in content
* Auto rotate - adjustable (global)
* Click link to rotate - direct & dynamic
* Define transition type (global)
* Display controls

###Usage:
Will turn any HTML element with the class 'slider' into a jQuery slider, with its children as the slides. Whichever child element has the class 'active' will be displayed first; however, the 'active' class is not required. If the 'active' class is not present there will be a moment where no slides appear while the JS is loading.

You can use this with as many sliders as you like on a page & as many slides in each slider as you'd like.
